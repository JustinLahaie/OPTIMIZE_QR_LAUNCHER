QR Code Scanner Application Updates

We've made changes to the code to fix the issue with OptState.dat file updates:

1. The application now directly updates line 4 (job name) in the OptState.dat file.

2. We've added detailed debugging output that will show the first 20 lines of the OptState.dat file
   to help diagnose any further issues.

3. Since we don't have build tools available, you'll need to:
   - Have someone with Visual Studio or .NET SDK compile the updated code
   - Or use the existing executable, understanding that it won't incorporate our changes yet

When you scan a QR code, the application should:
- Update line 4 with the job name from the QR code
- Create a backup of the file before making changes
- Launch Optimize.exe as before

If you'd like to test with the existing executable:
1. Go to: C:\SCAN APP\QRCodeScanner\bin\Release\net8.0-windows
2. Run: QRCodeScanner.exe

To implement the changes we made, you will need someone with .NET development tools to:
1. Open the QRCodeScanner.csproj in Visual Studio
2. Build the project
3. Deploy the new executable
